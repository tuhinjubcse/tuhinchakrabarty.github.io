## About
I am a graduate student in Computer Science at Columbia University ,working under Professor Kathleen McKeown on Natural Language Processing . I closely collaborate with her PHD student Christopher Hidey and Professor Smaranda Muresan. I am highly interested in Computational models of Social Science , Argumentation Mining , modeling implicit semantics & transfer learning for NLP  . Prior to joining Grad school I was a backend engineer at UBER and Amazon .

My current research involves building better models for end to end argumentation mining of dialogue . One of the end goals is also to identify semantics of argumentative components to help generate persuasive language . In Spring 2018
I also spent some time modeling discourse coherence and finding best sentence ordering in feedback messages.

I have found new interest in developing computational models for Fact Checking. I am also trying on correlating Rhetorical Structure theory discourse relations to argument schemes currently. 

I dream of a juncture when I'll own powerful GPU's to train architechtures like BERT or OPENAI-GPT in minutes. 
I will be at NAACL 2019 held at Minneapolis. Say Hi maybe ?



I took <br />
- COMS 4705(Natural Language Processing) with Professor Michael Collins in Fall 2017 and finished with an A <br />
- COMS E6998(NLP in Context : Computational Models of Social Meaning) with Smaranda Muresan in Spring 2018 and topped the class with an A+ <br />
- I spent my summers at Amazon Alexa, Natural Language Understanding Group in Boston  as an Applied  Scientist Intern

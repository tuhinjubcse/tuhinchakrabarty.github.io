## About
I am a graduate student in Computer Science at Columbia University ,working under Professor Kathleen McKeown on Natural Language Processing . I closely collaborate with her PHD student Christopher Hidey and Professor Smaranda Muresan. I am highly interested in Computational models of Social Science , Argumentation Mining and Information Extraction . Prior to joining Grad school I was a backend engineer at UBER and Amazon .

My current research involves building better models for end to end argumentation mining of dialogic corpus . One of the end goals is also to identify semantics of argumentative components to help generate persuasive language . In Spring 2018
I also spent some time modelling discourse coherence and finding best sentence ordering in feedback messages.

I took <br />
- COMS 4705(Natural Language Processing) with Professor Michael Collins in Fall 2017 <br />
- COMS E6998(NLP in Context : Computational Models of Social Meaning) with Smaranda Muresan in Spring 2018 <br />
- I will be spending my summers at Amazon Alexa, Natural Language Understanding Group in Boston  as an Applied  Scientist Intern

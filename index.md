## About
I am a 2nd year Masters student in Computer Science at Columbia University ,working under Professor Kathleen McKeown on Natural Language Processing . I closely collaborate with her PHD student Christopher Hidey . I am highly interested in Computational models of Social Science and Argumentation Mining . Prior to joining Grad school I was a backend engineer at UBER and Amazon .

My current research involves building better models for end to end argumentation mining of dialogic corpus . One of the end goals is also to identify semantics of argumentative components to help generate persuasive language .
